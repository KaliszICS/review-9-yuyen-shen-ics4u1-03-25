# Instructions  

  ## Questions

1. 
Create a function called _lettersToFive_ that takes a String and a character as parameters. </br>
Using a while loop, output how many letters into the word it takes to find 5 instances of the character.</br>
If there are no instances of the character, return -1.</br>

Examples:

```
lettersToFive("hello lillian", 'l')
returns: 10
```

```
countLetter("Whatever", 'e')
returns: -1
```

2.

Create a function called _countLetter_ which takes in a String and a character.</br>
Return the amount of occurances of the character in the String.</br>

Examples:

```
countLetter("hello", 'l')
returns: 2
```

```
countLetter("I don't know", 'e')
returns: 0
```

3. 

Create a function called _oddSum_ which takes in two integers as parameters.
returns the sum of all odd integers between the two numbers inclusively.
Order of the integers does not matter

Examples:

```
oddSum(2, 6)
returns: 8
```
Explanation: 3+5 = 8

```
oddSum(0, 10)
returns 25
```
Explanation: 1+3+5+7+9 = 25

```
oddSum(9, 2)
returns 24
```
Explanation: 3+5+7+9 = 24
